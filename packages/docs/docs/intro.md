# Findkit

Findkit is a toolkit for building search user interfaces for websites which
consists of three main components:

1. Cloud hosted website crawler which is managed using our CLI tool
2. CORs compatible API endpoint for making search requests
3. Hot linkable / npm installable open source Javascript UI-library

There is also an optional [WordPress
Plugin](/wordpress-plugin/) for WordPress users but Findkit
can work with any website without any Findkit specific code.
